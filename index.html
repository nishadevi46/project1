            Once you start seeing life as it is
            and you have no idea how it should be,
            everything is perfect…
            Even imperfection is perfect.
            What I mean when I say life is perfect
            is a simple thing: I mean don’t bring your ideals to it;
            otherwise you make life imperfect,
            because once you bring the ideal
            then you are creating the imperfection…

            It is important to consider yourself just as a flower. You should focus on your work, and not compete with others around you. This is compared with the help of a metaphor of a flower to make an easy resemblance.

            Take notice of the world around you. See how the sky, ocean, trees and flowers do not seek to control or manipulate. They do not “do” anything and yet nothing is left undone.Imagine life with no struggling against the natural flow of life, working with the rythym of the waves in the ocean of your life, and allowing others to live in their own flow.
