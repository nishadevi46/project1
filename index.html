            Once you start seeing life as it is
            and you have no idea how it should be,
            everything is perfect…
            Even imperfection is perfect.
            What I mean when I say life is perfect
            is a simple thing: I mean don’t bring your ideals to it;
            otherwise you make life imperfect,
            because once you bring the ideal
            then you are creating the imperfection…

            It is important to consider yourself just as a flower. You should focus on your work, and not compete with others around you. This is compared with the help of a metaphor of a flower to make an easy resemblance.
